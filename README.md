import type { NextConfig } from "next";

const nextConfig: NextConfig = {
  reactStrictMode: true,
  env: {
    magentoEndpoint: 'https://<your-domains>/graphql',
    baseURL: 'https://<your-domains>/',
    baseURLWithoutTrailingSlash: 'https://<your-domains>',
    siteLogoURL: '/Logo/EcommerceLogo.png'
  },
  staticPageGenerationTimeout: 300000,
  trailingSlash: true,
  images: {
    domains: ['<your-domains>'], // Add your domain here
  },
};

export default nextConfig;
```
