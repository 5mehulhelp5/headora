Simply drop your items in the mail and we’ll take care of the rest, including professionally photographing and listing your item.</p>

                    <h4 className="sell-select-right">How does TrueFacet's consignment process work?</h4>
                    <p className={styles.contentParagraph}>To consign with TrueFacet, complete a quick Consignment Request Form here and our concierge associates will be in touch with a prepaid insured shipping label. Then simply drop your items in the mail.</p>
                    <p className={styles.contentParagraph}>Once your package arrives at our offices, we will confirm the receipt of your items via e-mail. Our team of authenticators will appraise your items and provide a free valuation which you can approve or decline. After you approve, we will professionally photograph and list your items on TrueFacet. The complete consignment process typically takes 5-7 days, from the receipt of your item.</p>
                    <p className={styles.contentParagraph}>Items that are deemed inauthentic will not be uploaded for sale. If an item is beyond repair it will be returned to the seller. We require that you allow us 180 days to sell your item. If you want it back prior to the 180 days, there is a $20 fee so we can cover our costs for appraising and shipping. Otherwise, we'll ship it free of charge after the minimum holding period.</p>

Our authenticators each have over 10 years of training in valuing watches and jewelry. Any items that do not fit our rigorous quality standards or are deemed inauthentic are not accepted by TrueFacet.</p>
                    <h4>What happens if I consign items and then request that they be sent back to me?</h4>
                    <p className={styles.contentParagraph}>You can request your items back at any time. The minimum consignment holding period is 180 days. We can return your items before this end date and require a flat-rate $20 shipping fee to send your consigned items back.</p>
